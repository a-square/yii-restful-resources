# History

The library was originally developed for [Lightsoft Research](http://lightsoft.ru) as a part of larger REST toolkit, and then opensourced with the company's permission.

The namespace `Lightsoft\REST` was left in so that an improved version of the library could be seamlessly integrated with the company's existing projects.
